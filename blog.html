            <p>Denji is robbed of a normal teenage life, left with nothing but his deadbeat father's overwhelming debt.
                His only companion is his pet, the chainsaw devil Pochita, with whom he slays devils for money that
                inevitably ends up in the yakuza's pockets. All Denji can do is dream of a good, simple life: one with
                delicious food and a beautiful girlfriend by his side. But an act of greedy betrayal by the yakuza leads
                to Denji's brutal, untimely death, crushing all hope of him ever achieving happiness. Remarkably, an old
                contract allows Pochita to merge with the deceased Denji and bestow devil powers on him, changing him
                into a hybrid able to transform his body parts into chainsaws. Because Denji's new abilities pose a
                significant risk to society, the Public Safety Bureau's elite devil hunter Makima takes him in, letting
                him live as long as he obeys her command. Guided by the promise of a content life alongside an
                attractive woman, Denji devotes everything and fights with all his might to make his naive dreams a
                reality</p>

            <h1 class="heading2">Blue Lock</h1>
            <img src="img/blue lock.jpg" alt="">
            <p>After reflecting on the current state of Japanese soccer, the Japanese Football Association decides to
                hire the enigmatic and eccentric coach Jinpachi Ego to achieve their dream of winning the World Cup.
                Believing that Japan has lacked an egoistic striker hungry for goals, Jinpachi initiates the Blue Lock—a
                prison-like facility where three hundred talented strikers from high schools all over Japan are isolated
                and pitted against each other. The sole survivor of Blue Lock will earn the right to become the national
                team's striker, and those who are defeated shall be banned from joining the team forever. Selected to
                join this risky project is Yoichi Isagi, a striker who failed to bring his high school soccer team to
                the national tournament. After choosing to pass to a teammate who missed instead of scoring on his own,
                he could not help but wonder if the results would have been different had he been more selfish. Using
                this golden opportunity given by the Blue Lock Project, Yoichi aims to clear his doubts and chase his
                ultimate desire—to become the greatest striker in the world and lead Japan to World Cup glory. </p>

            <img src="img/es.png" alt="">
            <p>Great heroes and diabolical villains are the types of characters that people long to be—but not Cid
                Kagenou. He longs to become the true mastermind behind it all, pulling the strings, and having his
                machinations drive the entire story. In his previous life in modern-day Japan, he was not able to
                achieve his goals. But now, reborn into a world of magic, he will show the true eminence of shadow! As
                Cid pretends to be just another average mob character, he recruits members to his (fake) organization
                Shadow Garden, aiming to take down the mysterious cult who lurks in the shadows. With plenty of ad-libs,
                Cid leads his (fake) organization against the foul (yet surprisingly real) Diabolos Cult.</p>

            <img src="img/beast tame.avif" alt="">
            <p>Among all the beasts that roam the world, there are unique types of "ultimate species" that harbor
                immense strength and magical prowess considered to be at the top of the power scale. As such, many
                humans covet their abilities, leading some of these species to the brink of extinction. As a beast
                tamer, Rein Shroud can employ the assistance of various animals for many tasks, such as reconnaissance
                and logistics. By virtue of his ability, he joins a party led by the vile and manipulative hero Arios
                Orlando, only to be banished after six months due to his uselessness as a non-combative class. However,
                unbeknownst to the team that cast him away, Rein is an exception among beast tamers. His potential
                becomes apparent when he meets Kanade—a cat spirit who is also one of the ultimate species—and is able
                to form a contract with her. With Kanade by his side, Rein sets out on his journey as an adventurer,
                steadily rising up the ranks and meeting more ultimate species along the way</p>

            <p>Tooru Kirishima's notoriety is spread far and wide in the underworld. He is most commonly known as "The
                Demon of Sakuragi"—a man who is not afraid to resort to violence if deemed necessary. After almost
                jeopardizing a peace treaty, his boss tasks him with the most difficult job he has ever had: taking care
                of seven-year-old Yaeka Sakuragi—the boss' precious daughter—so that Tooru understands what it means to
                be responsible for another life. At first, the two do not seem to meet eye to eye, as Tooru has no clue
                on how to communicate with Yaeka, and the young girl is not used to expressing her emotions. However, as
                time goes on, they come to understand each other despite their differences. The fearsome right-hand man
                of a yakuza boss and the child he must protect are about to learn that family is not always bound by
                blood.</p>
